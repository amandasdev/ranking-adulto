Bridgetitle: Brickblock...bridging gap between cryptos and real world assets

----

Bridgetext: 

The rising global demand for cryptocurrencies calls for a compliant infrastructure platform and a legal framework that seamlessly connect âbrick & mortarâ investments with cryptocurrencies. 
 
Brickblock aims to be the de facto standard to invest in and out of traded assets

Useslist:

  icon: icon2
  title: CRYPTO FUNDS
  content: 'There are two types of Crypto Funds: actively-managed CFs and passively-managed CFs.'
  text: |
    In the active CF section, Brickblock will make it possible for projects like Taas and Iconomi to offer their funds to the public. Fund managers can apply to manage investorsâ funds by selecting specific cryptocurrencies, day-trading and taking profits out of diversifying portfolios and active distribution of funds. The user can decide on which strategy(ies) to endorse and which fund managers to work with.
    
    In the passive CF section, Brickblock will only accept a blend of institutions that offer rule-based indices. Since there is no passive CF yet, we plan to introduce a system based on passive ETFs. A foundation that will comprise of selected leading members of the crypto community will be established to improve the system and standardize the procedures
- 
  icon: icon1
  title: EXCHANGE TRADED FUNDS
  content: >
    ETFs reassemble whole industries or
    indices with only one share, therefore
    reducing the risks extremely. Brickblock
    offers access to worldwide ETFs, also to
    commodities like gold or silver, through
    specialized brokers.
  text: 'Most ETFs outperform their mutual funds competitors in the long run. Their low management cost and ability to track certain indices like S&P 500 and Nikkei or commodities such as gold and silver give them the advantage of being offered at near wholesale prices without a minimum amount. With ETFs, investors can choose their preferred investment market while hedging risk in another industry. Brickblock will commence with ETFs that track global indices. Later, it will rely on community consensus for other ETFs to be added to its portfolio'
- 
  icon: icon0
  title: REAL ESTATE FUNDS
  content: >
    Investing in real estate comes with a
    huge diversification potential, due to a
    low link to major asset classes.
    Brickblock lists Real Estate Funds with
    high potential and steady income.
  text: >
    Choose between Real Estate Funds (REFs),
    Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) or
    Real Estate Crowdfundings (RECs) to
    invest in real estate projects with high
    potential as listed on the Brickblock
    platform. REFsâ two growth functions
    center on the value of the real estate
    having the potential to grow over time
    and producing a steady income which is
    distributed to shareholders via smart
    contracts or invested in new real
    estate. The Digital Trust structure
    drastically reduces legal and stamp fees
    in transfers and escrow holding
    complexities. Brickblock will start with
    European and Asian REFs then extend to
    global funds.

  title: 24/7 TRADING

  content: >
    The existing out-dated clearing and
    settlement processes take two days.

    costs and time to confirm the trade on
    the unalterable blockchain.
- 
  title: '100% ASSET BACKED'
  content: >
    All real-world assets are physically
    stored and only claimable by the

    dividend payouts are only linked to
    self-executing auditable smart
    contracts.
- 
  title: TRANSPARENT
  content: >

  title: SECURE
  content: >
    Asset-backed tokens provide the
    possibility to switch the risk of
    cryptocurrencies into real assets
    without having to first exchange them
    into fiat currency
