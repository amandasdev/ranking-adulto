Howtitle: HOW BRICKBLOCK WORKS

----

Howtext: Brickblock enables users to invest in several traded assets irrespective of the size of their investment portfolio. It uses smart contracts to handle micro as well as big investments thus offering lower fees and better prices than traditional banks. Users get an asset-backed token with a unique denomination after each investment. The tokens are easily tradable on cryptocurrency exchanges than on stock markets. Assets are also redeemable from the Digital Trust at any time.

Techtitle: TECHNOLOGY USED BY BRICKBLOCK

----

Techtext: Brickblock will setup a parent smart contract which will help create further contacts between fund managers and investors. We envision that Brickblock will one day have to only verify a fund manager and give him an access code to set certain parameters that enable him to set up affiliated smart contracts which are automatically included in the dApp. Users will be able to authenticate the affiliated smart contracts through the parent smart contract. Therefore, all smart contracts are traceable to one address.
