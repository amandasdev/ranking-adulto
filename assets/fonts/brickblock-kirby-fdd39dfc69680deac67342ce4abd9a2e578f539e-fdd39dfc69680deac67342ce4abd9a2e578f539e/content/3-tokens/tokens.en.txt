Tokentitle: BRICKBLOCK TOKENS OVERVIEW

----

Tokentext: 

Brickblock tokens are an essential part of the platform. They give "mining right" that makes the production of Access tokens - necessary for every transaction on the platform - possible. There is a limited supply of Brickblock tokens and they cannot be reproduced by anyone.
 
Brickblock tokens and Access tokens are not the Proof-of-Asset tokens that you receive when investing in REFs, ETFs or CFs.
